# Programming in Science - Assignment 2

This is the starter project for Programming in Science Assignment 2. Written in Python and tested with Pytest.

### Question(s)

1. **(10%)** Lists - Finding the Maximum and Second Maximum:
   
   - Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum and second maximum values.

2. **(10%)** Lists - Removing Duplicates and Sorting:
   
   - Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a sorted list with duplicates removed.

3. **(10%)** Single-Dimensional Arrays - Cumulative Sum:
   
   - Write a function that takes an array (list) of numbers and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the previous elements.

4. **(15%)** Two-Dimensional Arrays - Matrix Transpose:
   
   - Write a function that takes a 2D list (matrix) and returns its transpose.

5. **(15%)** Slicing - Extracting Every Nth Element:
   
   - Write a function that takes a list and a step value N and returns every Nth element.

6. **(20%)** Arithmetic Operations with Arrays - Dot Product:
   
   - Write a function that takes two lists of the same length and returns their dot product.

7. **(20%)** Arithmetic Operations with Arrays - Matrix Multiplication:
   
   - Write a function that takes two 2D lists (matrices) and returns their matrix product.
